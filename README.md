Description
    Portfolio bio page on myself, Charlotte. There are three html pages: 
    1. index.html is the "About Me" page
    2. portfolio.html is the "Portfolio" page which will be coming soon! (none to add yet) 
    3. contact.html is the "Contacts" page where there are links to all social media and email accounts.

    Each page begins with a jumbotron with name written across followed by the nav-bar. 

Visuals
    There are two img files:
    1. Charlotte.jpg which is the picture of myself for the "About Me"
    2. mountain.jpg which is the picture for the background of the jumbotron.

    Upon that there is also a pseudo class of hover when you scroll over the "Coming soon!" in the portfolio.html, can be noted in the style.css sheet.
